1. Gameplay and tournament mechanics

**Joining and registration.** 
Players enter the game through TON Connect, confirm address ownership and top up their game account

**Draw and online matches**
Before the tournament starts, players can choose one of the available crypto teams and reserve it by making a fixed deposit. 
At the beginning of the tournament, the engine forms a tournament bracket and launches matches in real time, which are generated based on market data.
Throughout the tournament, the app hosts online broadcasts of match progress.

**Live tournaments "without pauses".**
In the game world, there are three types of tournaments:

-Daily tournaments where 32 teams compete "elimination" starting from 1/16 finals. Each match lasts 3 minutes, the team that grew the most or fell the least during this period wins. Prize fund is formed from players' contributions and automatically distributed among prize places. Anyone can participate.

-Weekly tournaments where 32 teams compete "elimination" starting from 1/16 finals. Each match lasts 5 minutes, the team that grew the most or fell the least during this period wins. Prize fund is formed from players' contributions, supplemented by platform bonuses and automatically distributed among prize places. Only a player who participated in at least one daily tournament can participate.

-Monthly mega tournament where 128 teams are divided into 16 groups of 8 teams, where they play first matches and return matches, and only 2 crypto teams from the group advance to the final part, where they compete "elimination" starting from 1/16 finals. Each match lasts 10 minutes, the team that grew the most or fell the least during this period wins. Prize fund is formed from players' contributions, supplemented by platform bonuses and automatically distributed among finalists and prize places. Only a player who participated in at least one weekly tournament can participate.

2. Economics

**Prize fund and payouts.**
 90% of entry fees are automatically sent to the smart contract; it is also supplemented by platform bonuses. After the final, the contract instantly divides the pool among prize places.
**Multi-level referral system.** 
By inviting friends, a player receives a share of their contributions; commission is paid in the same TON token and displayed in the wallet without manual actions.
**TON-chain transparency.** 
All deposits, withdrawals and reward distributions are logged on-chain: every transaction can be verified through the block explorer, and in the game - through the built-in operation history.
